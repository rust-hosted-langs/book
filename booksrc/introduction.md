# Writing Interpreters in Rust

Welcome!

In this _unfinished_ book we will cover some fundamental components of
interpreted language implementation.

At a glance, these are:

* An Immix allocator and garbage collection implementation
* A simple S-Expression language compiler for a virtual machine

We hope you find this book to be informative!
