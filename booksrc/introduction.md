# Writing Interpreters in Rust: a Guide

## Welcome!

In this book we will walk through the basics of interpreted language
implementation in Rust with a focus on the challenges that are specifc
to using Rust.

At a glance, these are:

* A custom allocator for use in an interpreter
* A safe-Rust wrapper over allocation
* A compiler and VM that interact with the above two layers

The goal of this book is not to cover a full featured language but rather to
provide a solid foundation on which you can build further features.

We hope you find this book to be informative!
